This includes customers’ behavior across channels, selling rate by geographic region and season, also the effectiveness of the web-sales channel.

Dataset
The basic dataset was taken from Kaggle. It includes the dataset of the retail company from 06-2012 to 06-2014. All customer data is anonymized.
